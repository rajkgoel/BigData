This project contains 4 Java files - 
a. Main.java - Containing "main" function that can be run directly and doesn't need any parameters to pass on. 
				It provides an interactive console application where user is provided with all options, which user can 
				select with specified numeric keys.
				
b. ElectionCount.java - This is an abstract class that is inherited by ElectionCountDirect class and ElectionCountTable class. 
				This class provides implementation following common functionality to inherited classes - 
					1. processElection() - Provides option to users to select either of options between - Add Votes/Find/Count/Quit.
								User can select any option by input'ing a number specified for resp. option.
					2. add() - Let the user add voting information from some user provided file path. 
								Uses the setVote(..) method, implemented in child class.
					3. find() - Reads the VoterId from console and outputs the candidateId for which voter voted for. 
								Uses the getVotedFor(..) method, implemented in child class.
					4. count() - Reads the CandidateId from console and outputs the total votes received by candidate. 
									Uses totalVotesForCandidates array to keep the votes count for each candidate.
				
				Following are abstract methods declared in ElectionCount and implemented in child classes (ElectionCountDirect and ElectionCountHashTable) - 
					1. protected abstract void setVote(int voterId, int candidateId);
					2. protected abstract Integer getVotedFor(int voterId);
										 
c. ElectionCountDirect.java - Defines an array as its data-structure to contain voting information 
				and implements required abstract methods as declared in ElectionCount class. 
				These methods works as per the array data-structure.
				
d. ElectionCountHashTable.java - Defines a hashtable as its data-structure to contain voting information 
				and implements required abstract methods as declared in ElectionCount class. 
				These methods works as per the hashtable data-structure.

Sample file is attached along with - sample_data.txt. First 5 records are valid records, where as last 4 are invalid records.
Please see the attached file - SampleRun.txt, to have a look at sample run.
